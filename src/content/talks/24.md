In this talk, we will give you a pragmatic introduction to `nom` , a famous Rust parser combinator crate, which, in other words, is a tool that makes it easy to create parsers even for more advanced use cases.

We will start by showcasing common suboptimal ways to do parsing including string splitting and using regexes. Then we will introduce nom and the main concepts it builds on, including its most commonly used functions. Finally, we will present several examples, from a few simple ones to building an entire parser for RESP, the Redis Serialization Protocol. If we do a good job, you'll probably forget about regex :)

Speakers:
Roberto Gambuzzi (@gbinside) and Luciano Mammino (@loige).

Roberto is a gray-bearded-wizard with many many years of experience using all sorts of programming languages. He has been playing with Rust in his free time in the last few years, especially solving advent of code and other interesting coding challenges.

Luciano is an old friend of the meetup. He is a Senior Architect at fourTheorem where he helps companies to adopt the cloud effectively. He has also been into Rust for the last few years building several side projects and now looking for some serious production opportunities.

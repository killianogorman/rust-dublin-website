## ðŸš€ Project Structure
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/       // Where blog posts are stored
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ people/     // If you are writing a blog post or a talk you must create a file about you
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ talks/      // Where talks are stored
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs         // This is a rust programme that should break up a markdown file and check for profanity
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.
## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
